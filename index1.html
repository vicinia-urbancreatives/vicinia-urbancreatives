<p>The Belem Tower is in the city of Lisbon, Portugal in southern Europe. This monument was erected for the purpose of service both as a gateway to the city of Lisbon but also as a defense system against possible invasions and attacks from the Tagus. This rampart was a strategic point also protecting the Jeronimos Monastery, which were strategic points to invade the city. King John II of Portugal (1455-1495), is at the origin of this building, as well as the fortresses of Cascais and São Sebastião da Caparica. The shores of Belém were once protected by a ship, the Grande Nau. This was replaced by the Tower of Belém a few years later during the last five years of the reign of King Manuel I of Portugal.</p>
